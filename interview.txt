How does a browser determine what elements match a CSS selector?
Browsers match selectors from rightmost (key selector) to left. Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector and traverse up its parent elements to determine matches. The shorter the length of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if that element matches the selector.

For example with this selector p span, browsers firstly find all the <span> elements and traverse up its parent all the way up to the root to find the <p> element. For a particular <span>, as soon as it finds a <p>, it knows that the <span> matches and can stop its matching.








Explain the scenario you would use translate() instead of absolute positioning? 
Translate is a value of CSS transform. Changing transform or opacity does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers reflow. Transform causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence translate() is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.

When using translate(), the element still occupies its original space (sort of like position: relative), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.



div, p - Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

div ~ p - Selects all <p> elements that are anywhere preceded by a <div> element

What are Sass, Less, and Stylus? Why do people use them? How does something like Compass relate to Sass?
They are CSS preprocessors. They are an abstraction layer on top of CSS. They are a special syntax/language that compile down into CSS. They make managing CSS easier, with things like variables and mixins to handle vendor prefixes (among other things). They make doing best practices easier, like concatenating and compressing CSS.

Bonus points for knowing how they differ and/or having experience using them. More bonus points for knowing what things like Compass, Bourbon, LESSHat, Nib, etc are and how they relate.



What are CSS counters?
