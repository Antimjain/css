There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky


Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}



affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}


An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}


An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest 
positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
} 

div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}


scroll and sticky div will not affect
div.sticky {
  position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: green;
  border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
}


The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
