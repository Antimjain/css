An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

NOTE: the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

outline: 5px solid yellow;


The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element.
The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

p {
  margin: 30px;
  background: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 1px solid red;
  outline-offset: 15px;
}
